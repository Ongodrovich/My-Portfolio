# 🌌 Cosmic Background Setup Guide

## How to Use Your New Cosmic Background

Your portfolio has been updated with enhanced artistic styling for the new cosmic background. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Save the Cosmic Image
1. Right-click the cosmic silhouette image (the one with the person's head surrounded by stars and nebula)
2. Select "Save image as..."
3. Save it to: `c:\Users\Ian\Desktop\n\assets\cosmic-silhouette.jpg`

### Step 2: Verify the Setup
The HTML has been updated to:
- ✨ **Removed blur filter** - Background image is now crystal clear
- 🎨 **Enhanced artistic overlays** - Multi-layered vignettes with purple, pink, and blue gradients
- 💫 **Improved glow effects** - Subtle light rays and color halos
- 🌟 **Better contrast** - Visibility enhanced while maintaining the cosmic feel
- 📱 **Responsive scaling** - Works perfectly on all devices

### Step 3: View Your Portfolio
Open `index.html` in your browser. The cosmic background should:
- Display with full clarity and vibrant colors
- Show the silhouette prominently in the center
- Have artistic light effects around the edges
- Complement your portfolio content beautifully

## What Changed in Your Files

### CSS Enhancements
- Removed 6px blur filter for better visibility
- Updated blend modes from `overlay` to `screen` for brighter appearance
- Enhanced vignette with 5 radial gradients (gold, pink, purple, blue)
- Improved shadow inset layers for artistic depth

### JavaScript Updates
- Added 'cosmic-silhouette.jpg' to the first candidate in the image loader
- Added console logging so you can see when the background loads

## If the Image Doesn't Load
1. Check that the file is saved in the correct location
2. Open your browser's Console (F12) to see any loading messages
3. Try hard-refreshing the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Make sure the filename is exactly: `cosmic-silhouette.jpg`
