# Professional Photo Setup

## To Enable the Hover Flip Avatar Feature

1. Save your professional headshot as:
   ```
   c:\Users\Ian\Desktop\n\assets\cosmas-professional.jpg
   ```

2. The file should be:
   - At least 500x500px (square is best)
   - Professional headshot (similar lighting to the sinister avatar)
   - JPG or PNG format
   - Keep file under 500KB for fast loading

## How It Works

The avatar will:
- **Default (no hover)**: Show the sinister/creative "NM" (Nova Morningstar) brand identity
- **On hover**: Fade into your professional headshot
- **Mobile**: Tap to toggle between the two versions

This bridges your creative persona with your professional identity as Cosmas.

## File Structure
```
assets/
├── cosmas-professional.jpg  ← Add your professional photo here
└── cosmic-nova.jpg         ← (optional) cosmic background
```

Save the photo, and the hover effect will activate automatically!
